I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Engineering, studying Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I am keen on exploring ways in which Data Science can be applied to help improve the quality of life for the average citizen.

## About Me

- **Name**: Tamanna Ahmad
- **Degree**: Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science
- **Languages Proficient In**:
  - C
  - Python
  - Data Analysis
  - Data Visualisation
  - Basics in Kotlin

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

### Project 1: PCOD Risk Assessment, Menstrual Cycle Prediction and Chatbot.
- **Description**: This project was developed by a team of four for the JITHACK '24 hackathon, which included myself. The project features a website that collects user data on a session-basis to analyse their risk of developing PCOD and to predict their menstrual phase. The PCOD risk analysis is carried out by a model trained on a Kaggle dataset, while the menstruation date and menstrual phase predictions are handled by a Python Flask application. An integrated Botpress chatbot provides personalised diet and exercise recommendations based on the user's current menstrual phase.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - Python 
  - Flask
  - HTML/CSS
  - JavaScript 
  - Botpress
- **Features**:
  - PCOD Risk Assessment: Utilizes a machine learning model to predict the user's risk of developing PCOD.
  - Menstrual Cycle Prediction: Calculates the user's current menstrual phase and estimates the start date of their next menstruation.
  - Chatbot Integration: Provides diet and exercise recommendations tailored to the user's menstrual phase via an integrated Botpress chatbot.
  - Data Privacy: Ensures user data is processed on a session basis without storage, maintaining complete privacy.

## Skills

- **Programming Languages**: C, Python, Kotlin (basics).
- **Data Analysis**: Analysis of Variance, Data Analytics, Statistics. 
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git, VSCode, MySQL, MongoDB, Tableau, PowerBI.
- **Other**: HTML, CSS.

## Goals

- To build innovative solutions that enhance the quality of life for citizens.
- To continuously improve my skills in data science and machine learning.
- To collaborate with like-minded individuals on impactful projects.
